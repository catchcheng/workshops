Instructions on how to set up your environment for the University of Toronto Data Science Team data science workshop.

The primary language is Python with the Anaconda Distribution. More specifically, we will be using Jupyter Notebook, an interactive notebook environment for python, built for stunning visualization and maximal clarity. Its superior versatility makes it the standard for data scientists to explore datasets and agilely test models.

Follow the instructions on the Anaconda Homepage to download and install Anaconda for Windows, macOS and Linux.

Once you are finished the installation, you are now ready to begin running our notebooks. Read the Jupyter Notebook Quick Start Guide to learn how to launch the Jupyter Notebook App.
